- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @MunchkinThunder and I guess I'm new here. Is this where me being the new chick has to stand up in front of everyone in awkardness while I try to tell you a little 
about myself? I'm really good at awkard so get ready. Lol just kidding at least for a bit until I get to know everyone. I'm what I believe to be a 37 year old 7th grade drop out
mother of two sassy pants but they get it from their Momma (*jumps up and down* thats me thats me) so I'm not to mad and engaged to a gamer who's into sex, drugs, guns, and word
games or should I say throat babies. Oh sorry for anyone not down with the youngsters and their slang that means he is an electrican *shrugs* excuse my spelling... 7th grade drop 
out remember but i'm working on it... baby steps. So yeah anyways gamer + sex + drugs + guns = electrican oh but not just any kind (just to warn yall im gonna be thinking/typing 
this in my best James Bond voice which you should be impressed with since I've never even seen the James Bond movies... *rolls eyes* dont be so shocked just wait till I tell you 
I only just saw Star Wars for the first time in 2018!* electrican marine electrician. Lol ok enough about them, back to me... Im 37 and recently went on journey... sounds mysterious
huh... mostly its been in my own head and let me tell you... phew it is not pretty in there... well ok its kinda pretty but in a completely crazy I've lived under a rock alone my
whole life... Tom Hanks and Wilson has nothing on me. So yeah I'm 37 totally cray cray and will drive you crazy if you let me... ok most likely even if ya don't let me but I'll
make sure ya having fun while you're holding on to that oh shit handle. Ok getting off track here. 37, cray cray, loves music with a play list even more bipolor then myself. Ok
my nerd is about to show herself but love all things Lord of the Rings (saw a tattoo once of Sauron hula hooping with the one ring and let me tell you it was a beautiful sight to
behold. Now I would say that would be my next tattoo but I like to be original so I'd have to find a way to change it up some and make it my own first. I am also a new lover (as of
2018 as stated about) Star Wars. I love to read though its been a minute cause I've kinda been going through a weird life phase the past 5 years. Mostly I like to read romance or 
scifi or fantasy but lately I've been digging reading up on computer coding. Oh and Native Americans too since I just learned I have some Native American blood in me. While reading
up on that I learned what the word plenary means (hope I spelled that right). Did yall know it means absolute unconditional UNQUALIFIED power? Soif I understood what I read
correctly that means that congress who is in charge of the bill of rights our MOTHER FUCKING FREEDON pretty much gave themselves or at least had a hand in giving themselves all
that pretty power while knowingly being unqualified for it. I'm still in the process of learning the 27 amendments and in turn understanding the Columbus way they are written. Not
that I think I'm so great or anything but I'm thinking I may run for congressperson. Apparently ya only need to be 30 and be an official resident of the state for which you're 
running. I'm thinking I might go to law school too. I think I'm decent at arguing and I don't mind getting down and dirty with some research. I like to say every lost court case is
only because they haven't found someone to argue good enough for them and I do like to argue... just ask said marine electrician and above all I'm about fairness... I don't
even wanna talk about how many times I've had to kick my own ass this past year. Self reflection can be a bitch sometimes but self harm and not allowing yourself to see any
thing positive you may bring to the table in you game if life is even worse. Anyway to make along story short I'm a 5 foot even tattooed ball of crazy whos said sexy gamer 
electrician guy let her buy a gun and showed her how to use it. Good things I'm nice and wouldn't shoot anyone unless they made me and chances are I'd be crying while I did it 
cause I'd feel so bad about it and lately I've been a major p***y with all this crying bullshit. I swear I can't even deal with myself most of the time. I seriously stress 
myself the fuck out on the daily. Hope I didn'y bore yall and would appreciate any pointers or advice anyone can throw my way but remember 7th grade drop out who is coming in on
step one... like "This is the power button" step one so go easy on my and don't judge lol. And if their is anything I can help anyone with (within reason... I aint trading no babies, just making that clear (thats a story for another time)) feel free to contact me. Looking forward to
seeing what I'll be able to learn from this sight! P.S. just passing on a little wisdom i've learving the past year... stay in school folks cause ya never know ya just might
be trading a baby for that W.I.C. box of cream of wheat. Write that down.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... At the moment I'm an oxymoron and can truthfully say I believe in nothing and everything at the same mother fucking time. Don't ask me I confuse my damn
self
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... anything and everything I can that catches ny interest.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... oh, oh ,oh I'm super excited to say I am writing my own language. I have most of the alphabet. Its gonna be a pretty straight forward real
talk speak so once thats done I'm thinking made a few symbols and represent whole words and then I'll see where it goes from there. Also am desiging my own crest maybe a family
motto or something. I already have my Clan/Tribe name set. You're seeing it here first folks. Introducing the Cov'era DiMon which currently consist of 1 member... myself but
open invitation to my two sassy pants mini mes and that sexy marine electrician guy. And just fyi The Cov'era DiMon stand for Love, Loyalty, Respect, and Understanding which is
oh so very imortant because you can talk to someone for all day long but if they don't understand the words they don't know if you're saying I love you and here is $100 or Fuck off
here is a $1.00 and I'm gonna steal a baby from you.
- üì´ How to reach me ... um... here. email i guess. though I think someone has been hacking my phone and computer and torturing me so I dunno if you wanna risk that chance. Though
be fair its been kinda fun at times... I try to keep even myself on the edge of my seat.
